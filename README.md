# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Noah Palumbo

### Lab Status: Complete

**Execution Instructions**
Compile using: "gcc -o piku piku.s
Execute using: "./piku"

**Issues Encountered**
For a while I was having trouble with the printf commands overwriting the registers, so I ended up refilling r0 and using printf threetimes. A loop could have worked as well.
